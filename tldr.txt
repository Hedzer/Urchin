Description:

A key and IV are fed into the keyschedule. The keyschedule keys and IV are now unchangeable.
Hashing algorithms used to pseudo-randomly entropy are randomized.
A random number of rounds between 32 and 64 is chosen.
FOR R = 0 to Rounds, transform & transpose the data
A new Word size, W is chozen between 16 and 64 bits 
A block B is fed into the cipher for encryption.
Block B is split into words of size W
each W is transformed by a pseudo-randomly selected transform
NEXT

transforms/transpose are as follows
